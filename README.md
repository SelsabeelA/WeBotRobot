## Project Requirments
- Create a maze
-  Apply any searching algorithm (BFS, DFS, A*, ...) to solve the maze with the lowest cost.
    > Note: the cost will be defined as the time taken per path or the number of U-turns or anything else.
-   Visualize the paths While the algorithm processing.
-   Save the heuristic information for each path
-   Test: use a robot to solve the maze based on the heuristic information
